# Running TYPO3

## Create TYPO3 project

For the first TYPO3 setup (make sure [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is installed):

    $ make create-cms-project

or

    $ rm -f htdocs/.gitkeep
    $ composer create-project typo3/cms-base-distribution htdocs/
    $ touch htdocs/FIRST_INSTALL htdocs/.gitkeep


Feel free to modify your TYPO3 installation in your htdocs (a shared folder of Docker),
most of the time there is no need to enter any Docker container.


## TYPO3 cli runner

You can run one-shot command inside the `TYPO3` service container:

    $ docker-compose run --rm typo3 typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh scheduler

    $ docker-compose run --rm typo3 bash

Webserver is available at Port 8000
