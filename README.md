This is an easy customizable docker boilerplate for any PHP based projects like _TYPO3 CMS_, _TYPO3 NEOS_, _TYPO3 FLOW_, _Symfony Framework_ and many other.

Supports:

- Nginx or Apache HTTPd
- PHP-FPM (with Xdebug)
- MySQL, MariaDB or PerconaDB
- Solr (disabled, with TYPO3 CMS EXT:solr configuration as example)
- Elasticsearch (disabled, without configuration)
- Redis (disabled)
- Memcached (disabled)
- Mailcatcher (if no mail sandbox is used, eg. [Vagrant Development VM](https://github.com/mblaschke/vagrant-development))
- Support for `TYPO3_CONTEXT` and `FLOW_CONTEXT` for TYPO3, FLOW, NEOS.
- maybe more later...

This Docker boilerplate based on the best practises and don't use too much magic.
Configuration of each docker container is available in the `docker/` directory - feel free to customize.

This boilerplate can also be used for any other web project eg. Symfony, Magento and more.
Just customize the makefile for your needs

Warning: Don't use this Docker containers for production - they are only for development. If you find it usefull for production please contact me.

Use can use my [Vagrant Development VM](https://github.com/mblaschke/vagrant-development) for this Docker boilerplate, eg. for easy creating new boilerplate installations with an easy shell command: `ct docker:create directory`
