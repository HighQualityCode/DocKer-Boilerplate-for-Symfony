# Running TYPO3

## Create TYPO3 project

For the first TYPO3 setup (make sure [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is installed):

    $ make create-project typo3

or

    $ rm -f code/.gitkeep
    $ composer create-project typo3/cms-base-distribution code/
    $ touch htdocs/FIRST_INSTALL code/.gitkeep


Feel free to modify your TYPO3 installation in your `code` (a shared folder of Docker),
most of the time there is no need to enter any Docker container.


## TYPO3 cli runner

You can run one-shot command inside the `main` service container:

    $ docker-compose run --rm main typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh scheduler

    $ docker-compose run --rm main bash

Webserver is available at Port 8000


## Error: Trusted Host pattern

Set in htdocs/typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php:

    'SYS' => array(
        [ ... ],
        'trustedHostsPattern' => '.*',
    ),
